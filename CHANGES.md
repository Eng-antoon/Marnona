# Changes to Fix Application Issues

## Issues Fixed

1. **CORS Policy Error** 
   - Problem: Files loaded via `file://` protocol were being blocked by browser security.
   - Solution: Implemented an HTTP server using `http-server` npm package to serve files over HTTP protocol.

2. **Firebase Authentication Error**
   - Problem: Anonymous authentication was failing with `auth/configuration-not-found` error.
   - Solution: Replaced anonymous auth with email/password authentication and added offline mode support.

3. **Firestore Connection Errors**
   - Problem: Could not reach Firestore backend, resulting in 400 Bad Request errors.
   - Solution: Implemented local storage fallback for offline functionality to ensure app works without internet.

4. **Missing Course Names**
   - Problem: Course names were not being displayed.
   - Solution: Enhanced data management to ensure courses data is properly loaded and displayed.
